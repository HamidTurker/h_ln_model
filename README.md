Our version of the Linear-NonLinear-Poisson model to test for multiplexed encoding of neurons, as introduced in Hardcastle, Maheswaranathan, Ganguli, & Giocomo (2017).
The code is adapted to accomodate data formats in the Smith Lab and the pipeline was made flexible to test for any number of factors (as opposed to just the 4 hardcoded variables
in the original paper).
